## How to use

Add the namespace to your document:

```csharp
using Pixeye.Unity;
```

Put attribute before variable and you are done ! 

```csharp
[Foldout("DESIRED_NAME")]
```

```csharp
  public class Player : MonoBehaviour
{
	[Foldout("Setup")] public Transform selfTransform;
	
	[Foldout("Data")] public int HP;
	[Foldout("Data")] public int AT;
 
}
```

You don't need to write [Foldout] attribute each time! Instead, you can add "true" bool check afther naming to put all properties to the specified group
```csharp
  public class Player : MonoBehaviour
{
	[Foldout("DATA OBJECT", true)] 
	public int hp;
	public int attack = 20;
	[SerializeField]
	private GameObject self;
	
	[Foldout("DATA ATTACK")] 
	public int AT;
 
}
```
